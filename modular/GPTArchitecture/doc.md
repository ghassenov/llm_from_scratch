## DummyGPTModel

* The **DummyGPTModel** class defines a simplified version of a GPT-like model.

* The model architecture consists of token and positional embeddings,dropout,a series of transformer blocks(DummyTransformerBlock),a final layer of normalization(DummyLayerNorm) and a linear output(out_head)

* The **forward method** describes the data flow through the model:
    * computes token and positional embeddings
    * applies dropout
    * processes the data through the transformer blocks
    * applies normalization
    * finally, produces logits with the linear output layer.
* Placeholders for the transformer block and layer normalization

## LayerNormalization

* **LayerNorm(emb_dim) class** ; emb_dim = embedding dimension, which in our case equals 768.
* Main idea: improve stability and efficiency of neural network training. We adjust the activations(outputs) of a neural network layer to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1.(aka unit variance).
* The variable eps is a small constant added to the variance to prevent division by 0 during normalization.
* The scale and shift are two trainable parameters(they share the same dimension as the input) that the LLM automatically adjusts during training to improve the model's performance on its training task.

## FeedForwardBlock

* **GELU class**: is a complex and smooth activation function incorporating gaussian linear units.
    * We implemented a computationally cheaper approximation to this function.
    * The GELU is a smooth,nonlinear function that approximates ReLU but with a non-zero gradient for almost all negative values.
    * This can lead to better optimization properties during training. (GELU allows for a small,non-zero output for negative values.Neurons that recieve negative input can still contribute to the learning process.)

* **FeedForward class**: a small network consisting of two linear layers and a GELU activation function.
* This network plays a crucial role in enhancing the model's ability to learn and generalize the data.
* It internally expands the embedding dimension into a higher dimensional space through the 1st layer,followed by a GELU activation function and then contracting back to the original dim.
* Such design allows for the exploration of a richer representation space.

## TransformerBlock

* A fundamental block of GPT and other LLM architectures.
* The code defines a class in pyTorch that includes a multi-head attention mechanism and a feed-forward network, both configured based on a provided configuration dict.
* LayerNorm is applied before each of these 2 components, and dropout is applied after them to regularize the model and prevent overfitting.
* This class also implements the forward pass, where each component is followed by a shortcut connection that adds the input of the block to its output.
* The shortcut connections helps gradients flow through the network during training and improves the learning of deep models.

## GPTModel

* The __init__ constructor of this **GPTModel class** initializes the token and positional embedding layers using the configuration passed as a dictionary, These embedding layers are responsible for converting input token indices into dense vectors and adding positional information.
* Next, the __init__ method creates a sequential stack of TransformerBlock modules. Following these blocks, a LayerNorm layer is applied,standardizing the outputs from the transformer blocks to stabilize the learning process.
* Finally, a linear output head without bias is defined, which projects the transformer's output into the vocab space of the tokenizer to generate logits for each token in the vocab.
* The **forward method** takes a batch of input token indices, computes their embeddings, applies the positional embeddings, passes the sequence through the transformer
blocks, normalizes the final output, and then computes the logits, representing the next
tokenâ€™s unnormalized probabilities.

## TextGeneration

* **generate_text_simple**: uses a greedy decoding strategy, meaning it always picks the most probable next token. It works by repeatedly feeding the current sequence of tokens into the model, getting the prediction for the next token, and appending that token to the sequence to form the new context for the next step.

* **text_to_token_ids**: This is a preprocessing function. It takes a raw text string and converts it into a tensor of numerical token IDs that the model can understand. It uses the model's tokenizer to break the text into subwords and then maps those subwords to their corresponding IDs in the vocab.

* **token_ids_to_text**: This is the inverse of the previous function and is used for postprocessing. It takes a tensor of generated token IDs and converts it back into a human-readable string. It removes the batch dimension and uses the tokenizer to decode the sequence of IDs into words.

* **generate_and_print_sample**: This is a convenience wrapper function that orchestrates the text generation process from a starting prompt. It handles setting the model to evaluation mode, preparing the input context, calling the generation function, and finally printing the result in a clean format.

* **generate**: This is an enhanced and more powerful version of generate_text_simple. It provides
    * *Temperature scaling*: controls the randomness of predictions.
    * *Top-k sampling*: filters the model's vocab to only the k most likely next tokens before sampling, which focuses the generation on plausible options and avoids nonsense.
    * *Early Stopping*: can halt generation early if a specified end-od-sequence is produced,which is useful for generating coherent paragraphs or answers without a fixed length.
