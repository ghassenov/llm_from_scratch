## LossMeasurment

* **calc_loss_batch**: This function calculates the loss for a single batch of data. It's the fundamental unit for measuring how well the model's predictions (logits) match the actual target tokens (target_batch). It uses cross-entropy loss, which is standard for classification tasks like next-token prediction.

* **calc_loss_loader**: This function calculates the average loss across multiple batches from a DataLoader. It's used to get a more stable and representative measure of loss over a larger dataset (like the entire validation set) or a specified number of batches (num_batches), which is faster than using the whole set.

* **evaluate_model**: This is an evaluation orchestration function. It puts the model into evaluation mode, turns off gradient calculations for efficiency, and uses calc_loss_loader to compute the average loss on both the training and validation datasets. This comparison is crucial for monitoring training and detecting overfitting.

## ModelTraining

* **train_model_simple**: This function is the main training orchestration loop. It iterates over the dataset for multiple epochs, performing the key steps of the training process: forward pass, loss calculation, backpropagation, and parameter updating. It also includes periodic evaluation and text generation to monitor progress.
